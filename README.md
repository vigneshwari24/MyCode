# Project Description
1. Simulation of DB2 Query Optimizer: (Available in DB2 folder)
  Wriiten in Java 7. Coded in Eclipse IDE. This project primarily focused on developing executable which takes userâ€™s DB2 query as input   and does optimization on the query, which normally DB2 optimizer does
    - Utilized IBM DB2 Z/OS for learning and testing of the code developed
  Sample query input is available in Commands.txt file. To view the output, edit input in Commands.txt and run DBMS.java

2. Interaction with Plant Genome Database using SQL Alchemy: (Available in Python/Final Code)
  Written and executed in Python 2.7. Used Enthought Canopy editor for implementation. 
  This project focuses on creating, editing, accessing and interpreting genomic databases in regards to a specific query.
    - Bridged the gap between genomic database and python programming constructs.
    - Created and edited the gene and sequence related tables using SQL Alchemy.
    - Managed nucleotide BLAST output using python and SQL Alchemy.
  To execute this project, a local set up of NCBI database has to be done. Full documentation of the project is shared in the folder,      under the name "CS223_Report.doc".
  
3. Simulation of modified DNS Server: (Available in UG project folder)
  This project focused on the reduction of network bottleneck and website access time on a large scale by analyzing the
  functionality of the DNS.
    - Altered normal role of DNS to reduce the web access time and network bottlenecks.
    - Modified DNS server system to forward requests to server on behalf of the client.
    - Introduced three-way communication to reduce response time and enhance the throughput.
    - Initiated coding for network programming, multi-threading and DB related code like JDBC-ODBC connections.
  Implemented and compiled using JDK 6 and NetBeans was used during coding. 
  To execute the code, do the database set up for proxy.mdb and dns.mdb and run FE.java
  
4. Shopping cart using NodeJS: (Available in NodeJS folder)
  This project is in progress. As a part of learning NodeJS, Express and Angular JS, I am developing the shopping cart application. 
  Current status: Implemented the application in console environment.
  Future plan: To extend the same as web application using Express and AngularJS.
  To execute this code, execute the command "node Shop.js"
